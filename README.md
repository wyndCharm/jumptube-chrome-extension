# JumpTube

JumpTube is a lightweight Chrome extension that makes it easier to navigate YouTube videos using chapters and segments.

Instead of manually scrubbing through long videos, JumpTube lets you open a small panel and jump directly to the section you want with a single click.

## 🚀 How It Works
JumpTube reads chapter information already available on the YouTube page.
If chapters are not visible, it may also detect timestamps from the video description to help identify useful segments.

All processing happens locally in your browser.

## 🔒 Privacy
JumpTube does not collect, store, or sell personal data.

The extension runs only on YouTube pages and does not communicate with external servers.
